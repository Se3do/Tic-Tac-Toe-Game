# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
- Description

This repository contains a JavaFX implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The game is designed as a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows two players to take turns and compete to win the game. Here's an overview of the key features and components of this Tic-Tac-Toe game:
# User Interface

- The game is built using JavaFX api, offering an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- It features a 3x3 grid for the Tic-Tac-Toe board, where players can make their moves.
- A status label at the bottom of the window informs players whose turn it is and announces game outcomes (win, draw).

# Game Logic

- The game maintains the classic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Two players, 'X' and 'O,' take turns marking cells on the board.
- The game checks for a win when a player has three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also detects a draw when all cells are filled, and no player has won.

#Images for 'X' and 'O':

- The 'X' and 'O' symbols are represented by images displayed in the cells.
- The 'X' symbol is represented by a custom 'X2.png' image, and the 'O' symbol by a custom 'O2.png' image.

# Clickable Cells:

- Players can click on empty cells to place their 'X' or 'O' symbol, depending on their turn.
- The cells are responsive to mouse clicks, enabling easy gameplay.

#  Game Outcome Reporting:

- The status label at the bottom of the window dynamically updates to reflect game progress.
- It announces the winner when a player wins and declares a draw when the game ends with no winner.

#  No Internet Connection Required:

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is a standalone Java application, meaning it can be played without an internet connection.
